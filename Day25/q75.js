// Question 75: Compound Assignment Operators: Use compound assignment operators to simplify arithmetic operations. Start with x = 4 and perform a series of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on x using compound operators.
var x = 4;
console.log("Initial x " + x);
x += 8;
console.log("After Addition " + x);
x -= 5;
console.log("After Substraction " + x);
x *= 3;
console.log("After Multiplication " + x);
x /= 2;
console.log("After Division " + x);
